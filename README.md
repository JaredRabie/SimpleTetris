# Tetris

The aim of this project is to develop a fully-featured copy of Tetris using Python as a project to develop my personal portfolio. 

Current Features:
 - GUI refreshing at 60fps
 - Green Tetronimo imported with lateral movement

Current Issues/Bugs:
 - The game checks for key presses at 60fps and since each tetronimo moves in increments, the velocity of each tetronimo is far too high. 

What I have learned:
 - Getting started with PyGame

Developed using:
 - VSCode
 - VSCode Source Control
 - Python
 - PyGame
